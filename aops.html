<h2>What is this shithole?</h2>
<p>  This websit was created by very desperate losers begging for attention.  It was created to educate young nerds about math, and milks as much money as it can by publishing
shitty textbooks that all have the same information and all have the same title (because screw creativity, amiright?).  This site owner is unfortunately addicted to the site,
and so far efforts by his underpaid friend to get him off this crappy site have been in vain, and though we hoped him failing a math competition would make him blame and leave the 
site, he has still not realized the egregious sin he is commiting</P>
